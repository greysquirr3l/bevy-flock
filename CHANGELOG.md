# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Planned work is specified in `plan.toml`: the budgeted think scheduler, the
continuum ambient tier, dialogue graphs and barks, snapshots and replay,
rollback, and the render, `avian`, and `replicon` adapters. Nothing in this
section is implemented yet, which is why it is a list and not a changelog entry.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-11-04

The simulation foundation.

### Added

- `FlockPlugin` with `FlockConfig`, four `CrowdPreset`s, and budgeted spawning
  driven by `SpawnQueue` (unique and recycled identity modes, 1 to 10,000+ NPCs,
  spawn budget per frame).
- `FlockSet` scheduling stages (`Spawn`, `Perception`, `Cognition`, `Steering`,
  `Integration`, `AdvanceTick`), chained so a game can join any of them.
- Boids steering with separation, alignment, cohesion, seek and arrive combined
  by priority-weighted truncation rather than a weighted sum.
- `SpatialGrid`: a uniform grid over a fixed volume with radius and k-nearest
  queries, deterministic result ordering, and no steady-state allocation.
- `RngStream`: PCG32 with per-NPC stream derivation from `(seed, NpcId)`,
  verified against the reference implementation and pinned by a golden vector.
- `Temperament` (Big Five plus bravery, sociability, industriousness),
  `Archetype` presets, `Needs` with decay and satisfaction, and a two-axis
  `Mood`.
- `BehaviorTree` with resume semantics, abort, a depth cap, and a flat compiled
  layout; `StateMachine` with dwell times and ordered guards; `Blackboard` with
  fixed capacity and compile-checked keys.
- `FlockRegistry` with the `LeafBehavior`, `GroupDirector`, `WorldDirector` and
  `NpcLogic` extension traits, and duplicate-identifier rejection at
  registration.
- Criterion benchmarks for whole frames at 1, 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000 NPCs,
  plus the spatial query and steering inner loops.
- Determinism tests that hash full NPC state in `NpcId` order and assert that
  identical seeds produce identical worlds, and that a larger population keeps
  the shared prefix of individuals.

### Notes

- MSRV is 1.97.1, matching Bevy 0.20.
- `glam` is pinned to the 0.33 line; `cargo tree -d -i glam` should never show
  two versions.
